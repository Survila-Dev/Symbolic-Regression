# Symbolic Regression by Eimantas Survila

This repository entails a symboli regression library with testing suite. This library is built on the [genetic algoritm library](https://github.com/Survila-Dev/Genetic-Algorithm-02) which was also built by Eimantas Survila.

## What is symbolic regression?

Symbolic regression is a [regressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) analysis which searches the space of mathematical expressions which could depict the given data set in an accurate and simple manner. The mathematical expression is modelled as a tree structure and a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) is applied to optimize such tree structure according to their fitness to model the data set.

Further detailed description of the symbolic regression can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/symbolic-regression-the-forgotten-machine-learning-method-ac50365a7d95).

## Guide to using the library

The library was developed with [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and the testing suite depicts how the library can be used.
